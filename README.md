# Installation
Download Python 3.8 or higher

```
git clone https://github.com/AlienFoun/happy_birthday-script
cd happy_birthday-script

for pip: pip install -r requirements.txt

for poetry:
  poetry install
  poetry update
```

Fill in the data to connect to the Telegram and PostgreSQL database in the file `config.py`. You can also fill in information about the launch time of the newsletter:

```Python
BOT_TOKEN = 'your_token'
host = 'your_host'
user = 'your_user'
password = 'your_password'
db_name = 'your_database'
hour = 20
minute = 0
```

# Usage

Open the terminal and go to the folder with the project, then start the script using the command `python bot.py`.

# How it works?

After turning it on, the bot will be available in Telegram. After that you will be able to send messages in a dialog with the bot. 

Available commands:

```Python
/start - Connect to send notifications of new free games
/stop - Unsubscribe
```

After entering the /start command, the user is checked to see if he is in the database using fuction

```Python
def sql_check_user(user_id: int) -> bool:
    cursor.execute(f "SELECT user_id FROM user_base WHERE user_id = '{user_id}'")
    rows = cursor.fetchall()
    for rows:
        if user_id in row:
            return True
    return False
```

If the user is not found in the database, he will be asked to subscribe to the mailing list; if the user agrees, he will be added to the database. If so, you will be informed at the time specified in `config.py`.

In case of refusal, the user will be offered to apply in the future. If a user enters the /stop command, he will be removed from the database and unsubscribed.

At the specified time the get_free_games script sends a request to the Epic Games Store API, after which we get information about the game name, description, original price, as well as the start and end date of the giveaway.

If we cannot get information about the start date of the game, it means that the game is being distributed at the moment.

After getting information about those games that are given away for free, all the information is formatted according to the pattern:

```Python
Game name:
Regular price:
Plot:
Link:
```
And this information is sent to users from the database.

Example:

The project uses a logging system to get information about what happens while the program is running. The command for logging starts with "logger".
Logger configuration information:
```Python
logger.add(f"{__file__[:3]}.log", format="{time} {level} {message}", level="DEBUG",
           rotation='100 KB', compression='zip')
```
